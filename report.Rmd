## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





<div class="col2">

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
input <- params$dfAvg

template <- "Indicator: %s
EQR: `%0.2f`.
Class: %s.

" # dont't forget the newline

for (i in seq(nrow(input))) {
  current <- input[i, ]
  cat(sprintf(template, current$Indicator, current$EQR, current$Class))
}

```
</div>
